# go_sandbox

Some scratch code, from my effort to learn [Go](https://go.dev/).

Surely not very interesting to anyone else yet. Sharing it here so I'll have it handy in case I pause my "learning go" push for a bit.

- My code from working through [A tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list).
- Some tiny apps to try out various areas.
